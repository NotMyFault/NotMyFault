### Heyo :wave:

👋 Hey, my name is Alex.   

☕ I'm interested in Java technologies, continuous delivery and integration.  

⌛ I am a [Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/) governance board member & core maintainer. In my spare time, I focus on contributing to UI/UX components, various plugins or lead core releases.  

⛏️ I'm working on a few Minecraft plugins too, such as [PlotSquared](https://github.com/IntellectualSites/PlotSquared) or [FastAsyncWorldEdit](https://github.com/IntellectualSites/FastAsyncWorldEdit).
