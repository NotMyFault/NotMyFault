### Heyo :wave:

🧑‍🎓 My name is Alex and I'm a Business sciences student (B.Sc.) from Germany.    

☕ I'm interested in Java technologies, continous delivery and integration.  

⌛ In my spare time, I contribute to the [Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins) UI/UX and a variety of plugins in the ecosystem.    

⛏️ I'm maintaining a few Minecraft plugins too, such as such as [PlotSquared](https://github.com/IntellectualSites/PlotSquared) or [FastAsyncWorldEdit](https://github.com/IntellectualSites/FastAsyncWorldEdit).
